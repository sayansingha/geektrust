This is a solution to the "A GOLDEN CROWN" problem from geektrust.

The steps to successfully run the solution:
1. npm install - For installing all the dependencies
2. npm start 'filename' - For running the solution
3. npm test - There are unit tests and feature tests written for the code, this runs the tests and gives us a report. JEST is used for testing.

A GOLDEN CROWN:

This project is a solution to the problem "A GOLDEN CROWN" from Geektrust.com.

GETTING STARTED:

Opening the zip file or cloning from the github repo will get you the files needed to get started.
Pre-requisites:
The only pre-requisite is to have an editor and terminal.

INSTALLING:

The following commands can be used to get the project up and running.

1. npm install -> Using this command in the terminal will install all the dependencies in the project(the dependencies can be checked in the package.json file)

2. npm start "filename" -> In order to start the project we need a file with some input. Once we have that file, we can then run the project by using this command in the terminal. A sample file named "input" has already been created with some sample input.

For example: npm start input


RUNNING THE TESTS:

There are some automated tests already built in the project. I have divided the types of tests to unit tests and the feature test.
Jest is used as a primary tool for testing in this project.

1. Unit Test:
These tests basically are testing the basic building blocks of the project. There are 3 different basic functions that are tested a number of types with varying inputs and outputs, that ensure that the functions do their job properly.

Example: The function "emblemFinder()" is tested in an exhaustive range of inputs to check if the proper output is given.

2. Feature test:
This test is used for testing the main feature of the project.

Example: The function "geektrust()" is tested in a range of inputs and checked if the desired output is given.


BUILD WITH:

JEST -> A testing framework.(https://jestjs.io/)
