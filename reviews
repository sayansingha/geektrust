Clean Code Practices:
1. Variables:
    1. Intention-revealing name,
    2. Meaningful distinctions,
    3. NO extra, unnecessary nouns,
    4. Make variable names easy to pronounce
2. Functions: 
    1. Does only one thing(abstraction),
    2. Use long, descriptive names,
    3. Avoid long argument list,
    4. Reduce aside effects(eg./ it doesn't change any original content, etc),
    5. Organize your functions according to the step-down rule,
    6. Should either query or modify(but not both),
    7.
